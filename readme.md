## Introduction

This repository contains a simple Python program that adds two numbers and a set of unit tests to validate the program's functionality. It's a basic example to demonstrate the concept of writing code and tests in Python.

## Program Description

The Python program (`add_two_numbers.py`) in this repository does the following:

1. It defines a function `add_numbers(number1, number2)` that takes two numbers as arguments and returns their sum.
2. The program then calls this function with predefined numbers `number1` and `number2`, adds them, and displays the result.

The unit tests (`test_add_numbers.py`) ensure that the addition function behaves as expected for various input scenarios.

## Usage

To use the addition program, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

2. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/addition-program.git
